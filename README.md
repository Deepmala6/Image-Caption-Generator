****Image Caption Generator
This project is an Image Caption Generator powered by the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model. The app uses a pre-trained BLIP model from Salesforce for image captioning. Users can upload an image, and the model will generate a descriptive caption for the image.
The application is built using Gradio, which provides a simple interface for users to interact with the model through a web interface.


****Features
Upload an image and get a caption describing the content of the image.
Interactive and user-friendly interface powered by Gradio.
Uses the BLIP model for conditional image generation.


****How It Works
The ImageCaption class initializes the BLIP model and its processor. The generate() method takes an image input, processes it, and generates a caption describing the image.
Gradio is used to create a web interface, allowing users to upload images and view the generated caption in real-time.

****Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for development.
Gradio: A tool to build machine learning apps with minimal code.
Hugging Face Transformers: For loading and using the pre-trained BLIP model.
Pillow: For image processing.



****Installation
Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-caption-generator.git


*****Navigate to the project directory:
cd image-caption-generator

****Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
.\env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows


****Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt



****Usage
Run the app:
python caption_app.py
The Gradio interface will launch, and you'll see a URL in the terminal. Click the URL to open the app in your browser.
Upload an image, and the app will generate a caption for it.



****Example
Here’s an example of the app in action:
When you upload an image, you’ll see a generated caption like this:
